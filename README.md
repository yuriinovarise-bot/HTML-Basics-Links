# HTML Basics – Links

This project contains an exercise about creating links (`<a>`) in HTML.

## Task №1

Links are essential elements that connect web pages together. Without links, the Internet would just be a collection of unconnected pages.  

A link is created using the `<a>` tag. This tag **must** have the `href` attribute, which contains the URL of the page the link points to.

### Example:
```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">link</a>
